The first version of GarminSync didn't work too well. It did download the runs from the GPS, but the resulting .tcx files were not valid, so they couldn't be uploaded to motionbased.com. Also, if there were pauses in the run, some track points weren't included in the exported. I've now fixed all the issues, and I've managed to upload all my recorded runs to motionbased.com.

[Download 0.2 of GarminSync](https://launchpad.net/garmin-sync/+download) and give it a try. It still has some bugs, but it should be usable. If you find something that doesn't work, you can [file a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/garmin-sync/+filebug), and I'll try to fix it.
